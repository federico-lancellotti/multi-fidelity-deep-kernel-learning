# Multi-Fidelity Deep Kernel Learning

### First step
Generate the dataset, a simulated video of a pendulum.

### Second step
Investigate the Intrinsic Dimensionality of the dynamical system, using the Levina-Bickel algoritm.

## To-Do
1. add a config JSON file
2. implement the Lavina-Bickel algorithm 
3. adapt the code to different sizes of the images (or keep the size constant but decrease the quality in some other ways)
4. add regularizer for the likelihood (?)
