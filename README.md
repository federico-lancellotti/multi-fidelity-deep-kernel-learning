# Multi-Fidelity Deep Kernel Learning

### First step
Generate the dataset, a simulated video of a pendulum.

### Second step
Investigate the Intrinsic Dimensionality of the dynamical system, using the Levina-Bickel algoritm.

## To-Do
1. add a config YAML file
2. resize the images (currently they are 500x500)
3. implement the Lavina-Bickel algorithm
