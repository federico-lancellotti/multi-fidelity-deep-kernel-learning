# Multi-Fidelity Deep Kernel Learning

### First step
Generate the dataset, a simulated video of a pendulum.

### Second step
Investigate the Intrinsic Dimensionality of the dynamical system, using the Levina-Bickel algoritm.

## To-Do
1. finish the main file (optimizer, trainer...)
2. add a config YAML file
3. implement the Lavina-Bickel algorithm 
4. adapt the code to different sizes of the images (or keep the size constant but decrease the quality in some other ways)
